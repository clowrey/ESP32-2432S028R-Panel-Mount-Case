# ESP32-2432S028R-Panel-Mount-Case

Panel mount case designed to mount through a rectangular cutout in 1.5mm thick steel or other panel material. 

Requires 54mm x 90mm rectangular cutout in your panel. To adjust for slightly thicker panel thickeness the back piece could be only extruded up to a certain height. 

Screw holes are designed for M3x15mm metric screws + M3 x 5mm long by 5mm wide brass heat set inserts 

If anyone actually uses this and does't have M3 insert nuts let me know and I can probably change that and upload another version with the M3 screws threading into the plastic itself..
